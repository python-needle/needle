Needle: Automated tests for your visuals
========================================

Needle is a tool for testing your CSS and visuals with `Selenium <http://seleniumhq.org/>`_
and `nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`_.

It checks that visuals (CSS/fonts/images/SVG/etc.) render correctly by taking
screenshots of portions of a website and comparing them against known good
screenshots. It also provides tools for testing calculated CSS values and the
position of HTML elements.

Installation
------------

If you haven't got `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ installed::

    $ sudo easy_install pip

As root, or in a `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_::

    $ pip install selenium
    $ pip install needle


Getting started
---------------

Create ``test_bbc.py`` in an empty directory::

    from needle.cases import NeedleTestCase

    class BBCNewsTest(NeedleTestCase):
        def test_masthead(self):
            self.driver.get('http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/')
            self.assertScreenshot('#blq-mast', 'bbc-masthead')

This is a test case which tells the Selenium web driver (by default Firefox)
to open BBC News and check the bar across the top of the page looks correct.
:py:meth:`~needle.cases.NeedleTestCase.assertScreenshot` take two arguments: a
CSS selector for the element we are capturing and a filename for the image.

To create an initial screenshot of the logo, we need to run Needle in
'baseline saving' mode::

    $ nosetests test_bbc.py --with-save-baseline

This will create ``screenshots/baseline/bbc-masthead.png``. Open it up and
check it looks okay.

Now if we run our tests, it will take the same screenshot and check it against
the screenshot on disk::

    $ nosetests test_bbc.py

If a regression in your CSS causes them to become significantly different, the
test will fail.


Selecting a WebDriver
---------------------

You may control which browser is used by Needle by overriding the
``get_web_driver()`` method::

    from needle.cases import NeedleTestCase
    from needle.driver import NeedlePhantomJS

    class MyTests(NeedleTestCase):

        @classmethod
        def get_web_driver(cls):
            return NeedlePhantomJS()

        def test_something(self):
            ...

By default Needle uses ``NeedleFirefox``, which is a wrapper of Selenium's
built-in ``selenium.webdriver.firefox.webdriver.WebDriver`` class. You may use
any of the following WebDrivers: ``NeedleRemote``, ``NeedlePhantomJS``,
``NeedleFirefox``, ``NeedleChrome``, ``NeedleIe``, ``NeedleOpera`` and
``NeedleSafari``. Refer to Selenium's documentation to learn how to install and
configure any of those WebDrivers.


Setting the viewport's size
---------------------------

You may set the size of the browser's viewport using the
``set_viewport_size()`` method::

    from needle.cases import NeedleTestCase

    class MyTests(NeedleTestCase):

        def test_something(self):
            self.set_viewport_size(width=1024, height=768)
            ...

This is particularly useful to predict the size of the resulting screenshots
when taking fullscreen captures, or to test responsive sites.

You may also set the default viewport size for all your tests with the
``viewport_width`` and ``viewport_height`` class attributes::

    from needle.cases import NeedleTestCase

    class MyTests(NeedleTestCase):
        viewport_width = 1024
        viewport_height = 768

        ...

Engines
-------

By default Needle uses the PIL engine (``needle.engines.pil_engine.Engine``)
to take screenshots. Instead of PIL, you may also use PerceptualDiff or
ImageMagick.

Example with PerceptualDiff::

    from needle.cases import NeedleTestCase

    class MyTests(NeedleTestCase):
        engine_class = 'needle.engines.perceptualdiff_engine.Engine'

        def test_something(self):
            ...

Example with ImageMagick::

    from needle.cases import NeedleTestCase

    class MyTests(NeedleTestCase):
        engine_class = 'needle.engines.imagemagick_engine.Engine'

        def test_something(self):
            ...

Besides being much faster than PIL, PerceptualDiff and ImageMagick also
generate a diff PNG file when a test fails, highlighting the differences
between the baseline image and the new screenshot.

Note that to use the PerceptualDiff engine you will first need to
`download <http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/>`_ the ``perceptualdiff`` binary and
place it in your ``PATH``.

To use the ImageMagick engine you will need to install a package on your
machine (e.g. ``sudo apt-get install imagemagick`` on Ubuntu or
``brew install imagemagick`` on OSX).

File cleanup
------------

Each time you run tests, Needle will create new screenshot images on disk, for
comparison with the baseline screenshots. It's then up to you whether you want
to delete them or archive them.

Set the ``cleanup_on_success`` class attribute to ``True`` to delete these
files for all successful tests. Any screenshots that differ from the baseline
will remain on disk for your inspection. Example::

    from needle.cases import NeedleTestCase

    class MyTests(NeedleTestCase):
        cleanup_on_success = True

        def test_something(self):
            ...

By default, ``cleanup_on_success`` is ``False``.

You may also activate the file cleanup from the command line by using the
``--with-needle-cleanup-on-success`` nose plugin:

    $ nosetests --with-needle-cleanup-on-success
