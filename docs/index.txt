Needle: Automated tests for your CSS
====================================

Needle is a tool for testing your CSS with `Selenium <http://seleniumhq.org/>`_ 
and `nose <http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/>`_.

It checks that CSS renders correctly by taking screenshots of portions of
a website and comparing them against known good screenshots. It also provides
tools for testing calculated CSS values and the position of HTML elements.

Installation
------------

If you haven't got `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_ installed::

    $ sudo easy_install pip

As root, or in a `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python setup.py install


Download `selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar <http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar>`_. By default, Selenium requires `Firefox 4 <http://getfirefox.com>`_.


Getting started
---------------

Run the Selenium server::

    $ java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar

Create ``test_google.py`` in an empty directory::

    from needle.cases import NeedleTestCase

    class GoogleTest(NeedleTestCase):
        def test_logo(self):
            self.driver.get('http://www.google.com')
            self.assertScreenshot('//*[@id="lga"]', 'google-logo')

This is a test case which tells the Selenium server to open Google, then check
the logo looks correct. :py:meth:`~needle.cases.NeedleTestCase.assertScreenshot` 
take two arguments: an XPath to the element we are capturing and a filename for 
the image.

To create an initial screenshot of the logo, we need to run Needle in capture mode::

    $ nosetests test_google.py --with-needle-capture

This will create ``google-logo.png``. Open it up and check it looks okay.

Now if we run our tests, it will capture the same screenshot and check it against
this screenshot on disk::

    $ nosetests test_google.py

If a regression in your CSS causes them to become significantly different, the 
test will fail.


Advanced example
----------------

Needle adds :doc:`a few useful methods <api/driver>` to 
Selenium's WebElement object. For example, we can check computed CSS values::

    from needle.cases import NeedleTestCase

    class GoogleTest(NeedleTestCase):
        def test_footer(self):
            self.driver.get('http://www.google.com')
            e = self.driver.find_element_by_id('fctr')
            self.assertScreenshot(e, 'google-footer')
            self.assertEqual(e.get_computed_property('font-size'), '13px')
